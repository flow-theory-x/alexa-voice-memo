# Environment Setup Guide

*Alexa Voice Memo - Environment Management Strategy*

## üéØ Environment Philosophy

Following **ideanotes „Çπ„É¢„Éº„É´„Çπ„Çø„Éº„ÉàÂéüÂâá**:
- **Start Simple**: Single `dev` environment for initial development
- **Scale When Needed**: Add `staging`/`prod` when business demands it
- **Cost Conscious**: Minimize AWS resources until required
- **Development First**: Optimize for development speed and learning

## üìã Current Environment Status

### Phase 1: Development Only (Current)
```
‚úÖ dev environment
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üèóÔ∏è AWS Infrastructure: alexa-voice-memo-dev-*
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üîß Configuration: .env.dev
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üé§ Alexa Testing: Real Echo device
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üåø Git Branch: develop
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üí∞ Monthly Cost: ~$0.03

‚ùå staging environment (Not needed yet)
‚ùå production environment (Not needed yet)
```

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Current .env.dev
CDK_ACCOUNT=498997347996
CDK_REGION=ap-northeast-1
CDK_ENV=dev

# Future environments (when needed)
# .env.stg - staging configuration
# .env.prod - production configuration
```

### Alexa Skills Configuration
```
üì± Amazon Developer Console Skills:

Current (Phase 1):
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ "Voice Memo" (dev skill)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Endpoint: alexa-voice-memo-dev-handler
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Skill ID: amzn1.ask.skill.xxx-dev
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üè† Personal Echo device testing
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Command: "„Ç¢„É¨„ÇØ„Çµ„ÄÅ„Éú„Ç§„Çπ„É°„É¢„ÇíÈñã„ÅÑ„Å¶"

Future (Phase 2 - Staging):
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ "Voice Memo Dev" (renamed for clarity)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ "Voice Memo Staging" (new staging skill)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Endpoint: alexa-voice-memo-stg-handler
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Skill ID: amzn1.ask.skill.xxx-stg
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üß™ UAT/stakeholder testing
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Command: "„Ç¢„É¨„ÇØ„Çµ„ÄÅ„Éú„Ç§„Çπ„É°„É¢Ê§úË®ºÁâà„ÇíÈñã„ÅÑ„Å¶"

Future (Phase 3 - Production):
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ "Voice Memo" (public production skill)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Endpoint: alexa-voice-memo-prod-handler
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Skill ID: amzn1.ask.skill.xxx-prod
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üåç Alexa Skills Store public release
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Command: "„Ç¢„É¨„ÇØ„Çµ„ÄÅ„Éú„Ç§„Çπ„É°„É¢„ÇíÈñã„ÅÑ„Å¶"
```

**Single Device Testing Strategy:**
- One Echo device can test multiple skills
- Different invocation names distinguish environments
- Dev/staging skills remain private (testing only)
- Production skill becomes publicly available

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline Status

### Current Setup
```yaml
Branches ‚Üí Environments:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ develop branch ‚Üí alexa-voice-memo-dev (‚úÖ Active)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ staging branch ‚Üí alexa-voice-memo-stg (‚è∏Ô∏è Prepared)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ production branch ‚Üí alexa-voice-memo-prod (‚è∏Ô∏è Prepared)
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- ‚úÖ **Automated Testing**: All pushes trigger tests
- ‚úÖ **Development Deployment**: `develop` branch ‚Üí auto deploy to dev
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Staging Deployment**: Ready but not needed yet
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Production Deployment**: Ready but not needed yet

## üìä When to Scale Environments

### Triggers for Adding Staging Environment
- [ ] Multiple developers working simultaneously
- [ ] Complex features requiring pre-production testing
- [ ] Need for user acceptance testing (UAT)
- [ ] Monthly active users > 50
- [ ] Business stakeholder review requirements

### Triggers for Adding Production Environment
- [ ] Public release to Alexa Skills Store
- [ ] SLA requirements (uptime guarantees)
- [ ] Compliance requirements (data separation)
- [ ] Monthly active users > 500
- [ ] Revenue generation from service

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Expansion Checklist

### Adding Staging Environment
```bash
# 1. Configuration

- [ ] Configure different AWS account (optional)

# 2. Infrastructure
- [ ] cdk deploy alexa-voice-memo-stg
- [ ] Verify DynamoDB table creation
- [ ] Verify Lambda function deployment

# 3. Alexa Integration
- [ ] Create separate Alexa Skill for staging
- [ ] Configure staging endpoint
- [ ] Test basic functionality

# 4. CI/CD

cdk deploy alexa-voice-memo-dev

# Emergency stack deletion (if needed)
cdk destroy alexa-voice-memo-dev --force
```

### Data Recovery
```bash
# DynamoDB point-in-time recovery
aws dynamodb restore-table-to-point-in-time \
  --target-table-name alexa-voice-memo-dev-memos-recovered \
  --source-table-name alexa-voice-memo-dev-memos \
