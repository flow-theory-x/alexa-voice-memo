## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### Staging Environment Setup
```bash
# 1. Environment setup
export CDK_ENV=stg
cp .env.dev .env.stg

# 2. Deploy infrastructure
cdk deploy alexa-voice-memo-stg

# 3. Test deployment
npm test -- --testNamePattern="smoke"

# 4. Enable CI/CD
git checkout staging
git push origin staging  # Triggers auto-deployment
```

### Production Environment Setup
```bash
# 1. Security review
npm run security:audit

# 2. Environment setup
export CDK_ENV=prod
cp .env.dev .env.prod
# Edit .env.prod with production settings

# 3. Deploy infrastructure
cdk deploy alexa-voice-memo-prod

# 4. Verify deployment
npm run test:smoke -- --env prod

# 5. Enable monitoring
aws cloudwatch put-dashboard --dashboard-name alexa-voice-memo-prod
```

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### Cost Impact
- **Staging**: +$0.05/month (minimal testing usage)
- **Production**: +$0.20/month (includes monitoring/alerting)
- **Total with all environments**: ~$0.28/month

### Alexa Device Testing
- **Current**: Use dev environment on personal Alexa device
- **Staging**: Can use same device (different skill name)
- **Production**: Available to all users after store approval

### Data Isolation
- Each environment has completely separate:
  - DynamoDB tables
  - Lambda functions  
  - CloudWatch logs
  - User data (no cross-contamination)

### Rollback Strategy
- Each environment can be independently rolled back
- Production rollback should be tested in staging first
- Emergency procedures documented for each environment
